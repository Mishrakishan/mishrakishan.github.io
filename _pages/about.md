### About
Hi, I'm Kishan, a theoretical physicist in progress with a passion for ML/AI and an insatiable curiosity about almost everything â€”from history and politics to philosophy, science, religion, and literature.
My work focuses on condensed matter physics, particularly topological solitons such as skyrmions and domain walls. As a result, much of my research revolves around spintronics and its applications. Recently, I have been increasingly drawn to the foundations of topological quantum computing, especially through the use of non-Abelian anyons, such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs).
I also at times write which is available at [my blog](/blog/).
