He was so curious to know what causes the sexual differences which require some degree of self-consciousness in the males, as weapons by which they fight for the female, or ornaments that attract the opposite sex.</p> <p>His previous theory of ‘Natural Selection’ could only operate to spread a particular feature through a population, no matter how advantageous it might be if the individuals who possessed it, managed to breed and pass it on. Sexual differences between male and female of the same species had bothered him for a long time.</p> <p>But what are the apparent differences between the sexes? As it’s been observed, exotic colour in insects and birds, ornaments like ruffs and crests, the longer manes in male humans, Antlers or horns being so much smaller, or completely absent in some female deer or cattle, the contrasting bright and drab plumage of so many male and female birds and butterflies.</p> <p>After a long period of observation, he came with the idea of Sexual Selection. It’s a mechanism operating alongside natural selection which determines the sexual difference between male and female of the same species. It is a mechanism of two parts — involving physical adaptation in males, but also the aesthetic sense in females, which in many cases played a crucial role in selecting males.</p> <p>“The essence of Darwin’s disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as facts— but as a process, as progression, as history,” Mukherjee writes. Darwin’s genius was the awe-inspiring idea of Natural Selection. On December 27, 1831, he circumnavigated from Plymouth, England on HMS Beagle and headed towards Cape Verde to reach the shore of his intimate inquisitiveness surveying expedition of the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. As a scientist-in-training his never-ending thoughts of collecting, observing and noticing anything worthy to be noted made him sail the boat for five long years across many islands. During his journey as he writes in his book The Origin of Species, that he strongly felt lonely, nauseated, and dehydrated at times while surviving on a diet of dry raisins and bread. He kept believing in and reminding himself to stay calm and mentally healthy to avoid any propensity for impatience, inaccuracy and misery. As the journey went on, the expected evolutionary biological traits perplexed and thrilled him with joy and confidence, that he began writing and scribbling in his notes and journals. He observed and drew finches, penguins, birds, animals encountered throughout his journey. After five years when he returned to England, his drawings were the evidence of his proposed groundbreaking scientific work and the profound idea of natural selection that he almost had formulated and thoerised. But he was wary to reveal his collection and theories as they were completely contradicting the existed biblical narratives on the origin of species. He writes, “In natural selection, organisms with genetic variations that suit their environment tend to propagate more descendants than organisms of the same species that lack the variation, thus influencing the overall genetic makeup of the species”. Later on, this idea solved many underlying and lurking religious orthodox, biblical stories, biological mysteries and puzzles.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*rtIJQkPfa1neEWflYvD2tw.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>The gene — An intimate History’ by Siddharth Mukherjee</em> In his drawing, there was no centre (as in Christianity, God firmly is placed at epicentre: all animals, created by him sprayed outward from the moment of creation). The thirteen types of finches he drew were not created by some divine whim, but by “natural descent” — cascading downward and upward from an original ancestral finch, he asserted.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*PjEmLTdraH14lLT5.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>A portrait of Charles Darwin and Title Page of ‘The Origin Of Species</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later, on November 24, 1859, his first book “The Origin of Species” endorsing the theory of Natural Selection and the fundamentals of biological evolution was published. His theory that time was not formally accepted as it was very challenging to the previously acquired wisdom of humankind. It took a while for our society to accept the scientific challenges Darwin made based on the shreds of evidence he collected, a life span he spent and devoted to observations, understandings and pursuit of science. His theory received a general acceptance around 1882, after 52 years of social struggle, almost when Darwin had the last moments of his gratifying endeavour and the invaluable contribution he made to the scientific societies.</p> <p>After he received a good amount of acceptance (validation) to his theory, postcolonial societies led by industrial revolutions extracted a set of ideologies as ‘Social Darwinism’ to define social, political and economic views when imperialism, racism and inequalities were breeding at an immense rate in the society. Darwins’ theory of evolution and Social Darwinism are two different theories where the former is a biological evolution that progresses by sharing biological traits genetically and the later is a societal change that shares morality, intelligence, strength, frugality and many more. Darwin completely despised the transferring-evolution of social values developed by humankind through generations.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*JcuJI7j-Ob8skckf.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Photo: Westminster Abbey Library</em> As an afterthought, he added “I think” above the page, as if to signal is the last point of departure from the mainland of biological and theological thoughts. His proposition “I think” above societal incongruity that all species have descended from a common ancestor is now a fundamental concept in science and the idea of survival “Natural Selection: endless forms and most beautiful and most wonderful have been, are being, evolved” is the grassroots of evolutionary biology.</p> </blockquote> <p>==Sometimes we need to really challenge our collective accepted wisdom in order to move forward. Because as long and as much time any theory or wisdom takes to transcend the physical time and persists in society, it gets harder and harder to challenge them and invalidate its gravity.==</p> <p><strong>Science and Technology continuously have been advancing with the progressiveness of society and research but in molecular and evolutionary biology Darwin’s genius and ideas have always remained central to the field.</strong></p> <p>Note: The following (<em>“A beautiful flock of grandalas!”</em>) contrasting colours and subtle differences were also studied by the Handicap Principle supported by many Evolutionary biologists, and is why peacocks have such long tails, even though they are a burden for flight and evading predators.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="darwin"/><category term="sexualselection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sexual Selection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still Vulnerable at 25</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Still Vulnerable at 25"/><published>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/"><![CDATA[<p>The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another. And realisation hits hard, and you fall down into an inward spiral in the depths of nowhere.</p> <p>The hot coffee would steam on a bright sunny day as you sit bored on your couch. Unwilling to move muscles, you would remain there, staring into the void while your brain would start to do “the talking”. The talks, most of, if not all the time, would be dark. Scared, you start craving activity. Yet, you wouldn’t want to cut ties with lethargy without a proper closure. So, you would start with a gentle peek out of the window. Muscle movement achieved! Like a yorker right into the black hole, the sun would slap your face tight. “The window was there for a reason!”, your brain wouldn’t seem to give up. You would stare at the world outside. You would wonder at a white feather being kissed by the winds, shining as its manoeuver past you! You would start falling in love with almost everything that you see through the window. “I see. Now what about this?”, our brain cuts in. Then, you would table-fan your head slightly to the sides to find gigantic wings on either side of your shoulders. “Hehe!”, the asshole of a brain would give you a manipulative laugh. It would make you want to use the wings because flying high would give you a different form of high. Adding fuel to the fire, the typical midsummer breeze outside the window would stage a ballet in your face. ” This gets interesting”, your brain grabs a popcorn while you stay there like a total jackass gridlocked by the two differently haunting weapons of choice. The window would almost slap harder as the breeze starts gusting, if not for the latch. It doesn’t stop there. The rooftop that’d been watching everything just above you blows out open and you see light entering and skies smiling at you.</p> <p>One of the quotes by Camus hits right in my face of vulnerability every time I get stuck in a situation like this,</p> <p><em>Sad to still feel so vulnerable. In 25 years I’ll be 57. 25 years then to create a body of work and to find what I’m looking for. After that, old age and death. I know what is most important for me. And I still find a way to give in to little temptations, wasting time of frivolous conversations or fruitless idling about. I’ve mastered two or three things in myself. But how far I am from the kind of superiority that I so badly need.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="solitude"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another.

You expect it to be easy. You expect it to be a world of roses and laughs and perfect moments that you find only in movies. You expect your partner to always say the right thing and always know exactly how you feel, or exactly how to react to it. You expect them to calm you down when you’re yelling or to chase you when you run away. You expect so much that you feel entirely, and utterly defeated when something doesn’t exactly match up with all your plans. But that’s the thing, love isn’t a plan. Love is a feeling. It’s that feeling you get when you know you are going to see that person. You are always counting down the minutes, the hours, the days or even months until you will see them again because you love that feeling you have when you are with them.</p> <p>Love is a feeling of perfect happiness. Being in their arms means that everything will be okay and even if it’s really not going to be, you’ll get a feeling that they’ll do whatever they can to make it be, or just to try to make you feel better. It’s that feeling that you are loved for who you are and you love them for who they are. It’s about how they are the first ones you want to talk to when anything is good or bad and how you are always learning something new no matter how long you’ve been together. It’s about changing and being a new person, not necessarily changing your ways or who you are, but wanting to be different and a better person simply cause that person is in your life and you want to be everything to them.</p> <p>Love doesn’t have a certain beginning and it certainly has no end or visible finish line to those deeply in it. Love happens, and it is so incredibly messy. You don’t just automatically love someone. you have to slowly learn to trust; Trust that they don’t cheat on you, trust that they don’t lie to you, trust that they truly admire you, trust that they will always be there for you, trust that they can go to a party and not get high or drunk, trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you, trust that they will never fall in love with another, trust that they won’t just get sick of you, and trust that they want you, like you want them. You want to be with them more to the point where you’re jealous of anyone who tries to be with that person. Then it gets you mad but you get past it, you can’t be jealous anymore. You can’t because you have this undying confidence that this person will never leave you, they will never betray you, and that they would never pick someone else over you, that you’re irreplaceable. That’s when the confidence hits you, that you really do love each other and it’s unbreakable.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="love"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love is a funny thing.
