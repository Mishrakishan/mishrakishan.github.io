He was so curious to know what causes the sexual differences which require some degree of self-consciousness in the males, as weapons by which they fight for the female, or ornaments that attract the opposite sex.</p> <p>His previous theory of ‘Natural Selection’ could only operate to spread a particular feature through a population, no matter how advantageous it might be if the individuals who possessed it, managed to breed and pass it on. Sexual differences between male and female of the same species had bothered him for a long time.</p> <p>But what are the apparent differences between the sexes? As it’s been observed, exotic colour in insects and birds, ornaments like ruffs and crests, the longer manes in male humans, Antlers or horns being so much smaller, or completely absent in some female deer or cattle, the contrasting bright and drab plumage of so many male and female birds and butterflies.</p> <p>After a long period of observation, he came with the idea of Sexual Selection. It’s a mechanism operating alongside natural selection which determines the sexual difference between male and female of the same species. It is a mechanism of two parts — involving physical adaptation in males, but also the aesthetic sense in females, which in many cases played a crucial role in selecting males.</p> <p>“The essence of Darwin’s disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as facts— but as a process, as progression, as history,” Mukherjee writes. Darwin’s genius was the awe-inspiring idea of Natural Selection. On December 27, 1831, he circumnavigated from Plymouth, England on HMS Beagle and headed towards Cape Verde to reach the shore of his intimate inquisitiveness surveying expedition of the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. As a scientist-in-training his never-ending thoughts of collecting, observing and noticing anything worthy to be noted made him sail the boat for five long years across many islands. During his journey as he writes in his book The Origin of Species, that he strongly felt lonely, nauseated, and dehydrated at times while surviving on a diet of dry raisins and bread. He kept believing in and reminding himself to stay calm and mentally healthy to avoid any propensity for impatience, inaccuracy and misery. As the journey went on, the expected evolutionary biological traits perplexed and thrilled him with joy and confidence, that he began writing and scribbling in his notes and journals. He observed and drew finches, penguins, birds, animals encountered throughout his journey. After five years when he returned to England, his drawings were the evidence of his proposed groundbreaking scientific work and the profound idea of natural selection that he almost had formulated and thoerised. But he was wary to reveal his collection and theories as they were completely contradicting the existed biblical narratives on the origin of species. He writes, “In natural selection, organisms with genetic variations that suit their environment tend to propagate more descendants than organisms of the same species that lack the variation, thus influencing the overall genetic makeup of the species”. Later on, this idea solved many underlying and lurking religious orthodox, biblical stories, biological mysteries and puzzles.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*rtIJQkPfa1neEWflYvD2tw.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>The gene — An intimate History’ by Siddharth Mukherjee</em> In his drawing, there was no centre (as in Christianity, God firmly is placed at epicentre: all animals, created by him sprayed outward from the moment of creation). The thirteen types of finches he drew were not created by some divine whim, but by “natural descent” — cascading downward and upward from an original ancestral finch, he asserted.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*PjEmLTdraH14lLT5.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>A portrait of Charles Darwin and Title Page of ‘The Origin Of Species</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later, on November 24, 1859, his first book “The Origin of Species” endorsing the theory of Natural Selection and the fundamentals of biological evolution was published. His theory that time was not formally accepted as it was very challenging to the previously acquired wisdom of humankind. It took a while for our society to accept the scientific challenges Darwin made based on the shreds of evidence he collected, a life span he spent and devoted to observations, understandings and pursuit of science. His theory received a general acceptance around 1882, after 52 years of social struggle, almost when Darwin had the last moments of his gratifying endeavour and the invaluable contribution he made to the scientific societies.</p> <p>After he received a good amount of acceptance (validation) to his theory, postcolonial societies led by industrial revolutions extracted a set of ideologies as ‘Social Darwinism’ to define social, political and economic views when imperialism, racism and inequalities were breeding at an immense rate in the society. Darwins’ theory of evolution and Social Darwinism are two different theories where the former is a biological evolution that progresses by sharing biological traits genetically and the later is a societal change that shares morality, intelligence, strength, frugality and many more. Darwin completely despised the transferring-evolution of social values developed by humankind through generations.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*JcuJI7j-Ob8skckf.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Photo: Westminster Abbey Library</em> As an afterthought, he added “I think” above the page, as if to signal is the last point of departure from the mainland of biological and theological thoughts. His proposition “I think” above societal incongruity that all species have descended from a common ancestor is now a fundamental concept in science and the idea of survival “Natural Selection: endless forms and most beautiful and most wonderful have been, are being, evolved” is the grassroots of evolutionary biology.</p> </blockquote> <p>==Sometimes we need to really challenge our collective accepted wisdom in order to move forward. Because as long and as much time any theory or wisdom takes to transcend the physical time and persists in society, it gets harder and harder to challenge them and invalidate its gravity.==</p> <p><strong>Science and Technology continuously have been advancing with the progressiveness of society and research but in molecular and evolutionary biology Darwin’s genius and ideas have always remained central to the field.</strong></p> <p>Note: The following (<em>“A beautiful flock of grandalas!”</em>) contrasting colours and subtle differences were also studied by the Handicap Principle supported by many Evolutionary biologists, and is why peacocks have such long tails, even though they are a burden for flight and evading predators.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sexual Selection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still Vulnerable at 25</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Still Vulnerable at 25"/><published>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/"><![CDATA[<p>The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another. And realisation hits hard, and you fall down into an inward spiral in the depths of nowhere.</p> <p>The hot coffee would steam on a bright sunny day as you sit bored on your couch. Unwilling to move muscles, you would remain there, staring into the void while your brain would start to do “the talking”. The talks, most of, if not all the time, would be dark. Scared, you start craving activity. Yet, you wouldn’t want to cut ties with lethargy without a proper closure. So, you would start with a gentle peek out of the window. Muscle movement achieved! Like a yorker right into the black hole, the sun would slap your face tight. “The window was there for a reason!”, your brain wouldn’t seem to give up. You would stare at the world outside. You would wonder at a white feather being kissed by the winds, shining as its manoeuver past you! You would start falling in love with almost everything that you see through the window. “I see. Now what about this?”, our brain cuts in. Then, you would table-fan your head slightly to the sides to find gigantic wings on either side of your shoulders. “Hehe!”, the asshole of a brain would give you a manipulative laugh. It would make you want to use the wings because flying high would give you a different form of high. Adding fuel to the fire, the typical midsummer breeze outside the window would stage a ballet in your face. ” This gets interesting”, your brain grabs a popcorn while you stay there like a total jackass gridlocked by the two differently haunting weapons of choice. The window would almost slap harder as the breeze starts gusting, if not for the latch. It doesn’t stop there. The rooftop that’d been watching everything just above you blows out open and you see light entering and skies smiling at you.</p> <p>One of the quotes by Camus hits right in my face of vulnerability every time I get stuck in a situation like this,</p> <p><em>Sad to still feel so vulnerable. In 25 years I’ll be 57. 25 years then to create a body of work and to find what I’m looking for. After that, old age and death. I know what is most important for me. And I still find a way to give in to little temptations, wasting time of frivolous conversations or fruitless idling about. I’ve mastered two or three things in myself. But how far I am from the kind of superiority that I so badly need.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another.

You expect it to be easy. You expect it to be a world of roses and laughs and perfect moments that you find only in movies. You expect your partner to always say the right thing and always know exactly how you feel, or exactly how to react to it. You expect them to calm you down when you’re yelling or to chase you when you run away. You expect so much that you feel entirely, and utterly defeated when something doesn’t exactly match up with all your plans. But that’s the thing, love isn’t a plan. Love is a feeling. It’s that feeling you get when you know you are going to see that person. You are always counting down the minutes, the hours, the days or even months until you will see them again because you love that feeling you have when you are with them.</p> <p>Love is a feeling of perfect happiness. Being in their arms means that everything will be okay and even if it’s really not going to be, you’ll get a feeling that they’ll do whatever they can to make it be, or just to try to make you feel better. It’s that feeling that you are loved for who you are and you love them for who they are. It’s about how they are the first ones you want to talk to when anything is good or bad and how you are always learning something new no matter how long you’ve been together. It’s about changing and being a new person, not necessarily changing your ways or who you are, but wanting to be different and a better person simply cause that person is in your life and you want to be everything to them.</p> <p>Love doesn’t have a certain beginning and it certainly has no end or visible finish line to those deeply in it. Love happens, and it is so incredibly messy. You don’t just automatically love someone. you have to slowly learn to trust; Trust that they don’t cheat on you, trust that they don’t lie to you, trust that they truly admire you, trust that they will always be there for you, trust that they can go to a party and not get high or drunk, trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you, trust that they will never fall in love with another, trust that they won’t just get sick of you, and trust that they want you, like you want them. You want to be with them more to the point where you’re jealous of anyone who tries to be with that person. Then it gets you mad but you get past it, you can’t be jealous anymore. You can’t because you have this undying confidence that this person will never leave you, they will never betray you, and that they would never pick someone else over you, that you’re irreplaceable. That’s when the confidence hits you, that you really do love each other and it’s unbreakable.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love is a funny thing.

I realised when Simba was sad from the tragic loss of his father and was abandoned by his friends for being purposeless and nihilistic in life. To escape this perpetual feeling, Simba flees away from his Kingdom, Pride Land. At an odd moment, he meets Rafiki, the advisor of his kingdom. Rafiki, as an old wise man, speaks to the inner self of Simba when he needed someone the most to find his lost identity and meaning of his life. He helps Simba rediscover himself when all he was lost, hurt, weak and drowned in the memories of his father and shouldering the guilt of his father’s death. Simba follows Rafiki to find the answers to lessen the burden he was carrying. After a long chase near a pond, a pebble grabs his attention where he sees him reflected as a strong and mighty king, not the immature and adult child he was. As a light sparks in the sky, Simba recalls his father and begs for help from him. The Spark reminds him of his father, and he follows the light-tail until it disappears.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:624/format:webp/0*F4SwISXfPwTs16k6.jpg" alt=""/></p> <p>Simba sits down sadly again, but Rafiki hits him with his stick — an overhead swing to show how other things (as his stick) can hurt if you are drowned in memories, regrets, and the past. Rafiki reminds him that if he can’t let go of his past, he slowly will degrade and lose his very present that has a promising future. He encourages him to accept his past voluntarily and easily, reminding him that, “An invented past can be useful; yes, It cracks and crumbles under the pressures of life like clay in a season of drought, but it will always bolster you up to make the right choices and save you from drowning in the hardest time when you need yourself the most.” Then, he cracks jokes, tells riddles and solves puzzles to encourage Simba to remember his forthcoming responsibilities for his kingdom and for his father’s sacrifice.</p> <p>Rafiki tells Simba that, in the course of being, we rise and fall and cry and smile, and it is inevitable. But we can transcend through the hurdles and challenges on our path and drive the journey to becoming who we aspire to be. We do mistakes, terrible mistakes. We rant and curse ourselves as we grow mature and realise by digging deeper into ourselves. Realising all of this could be painful for a moment. Well, It must be, Rafiki says, “but you either run away from it so you don’t get hurt or learn from it.” What has been done can not be reversed, but what remains to be done can be done with a better you. After all, anything that happens is not always a positive experience. However, if you frame it right, then almost all the experiences do shape you constructively. I believe that if you correctly articulate your thoughts, have good coping skills, resilience, and believe that you are truly in control of your actions, you can learn something from just about any struggle.</p> <p>Simba begins to feel better after carefully listening to Rafiki’s wise words, so the next time Rafiki illustrates his point, he again swings his stick at Simba. But Simba ducks, demonstrating that he has learned from his pain and past and won’t get hurt again, even though this time it was not overhead, but the hardest, a full cross-body swing. But he saves himself from getting hurt by learning from his experience and loss.</p> <p>We all need Rafiki (who knows the way) to guide us through difficult times in life, particularly when we’re growing up and are highly potent and capable of slaying the dragon. We are dynamite in our 20s. We have to conquer the shadow and fear of the unknown and open up the world of endless possibilities. It’s a continuous cycle of becoming and losing, and it’s never too late to stick to your journey and push the wheels along. Above all, we have to let go of things that hinder our mental peace to move forward forthrightly.</p> <p>After all, we all aspire to be like the stars but to do so, we have to be courageous enough to face the darkness and to keep moving to journey uphill, rather than in the fleeting sense of happiness awaiting the next peak.</p> <p>Also can be read at <a href="https://mishrakishan.medium.com/journey-uphill-5ffe75580945">Medium</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rafiki from The Lion King]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Journey Uphill</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/journey-uphill/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Journey Uphill"/><published>2021-04-07T17:53:17+00:00</published><updated>2021-04-07T17:53:17+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/journey-uphill</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/journey-uphill/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">‘Darwin’ Day</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/darwin-day/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="‘Darwin’ Day"/><published>2021-03-05T19:26:55+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-05T19:26:55+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/darwin-day</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2021/darwin-day/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">“Independence, Defence and Resistance”</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2020/independence-defence-and-resistance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“Independence, Defence and Resistance”"/><published>2020-08-09T13:09:32+00:00</published><updated>2020-08-09T13:09:32+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2020/independence-defence-and-resistance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2020/independence-defence-and-resistance/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry><entry><title type="html">Who to compare yourself with</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2016/images/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who to compare yourself with"/><published>2016-06-08T05:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-06-08T05:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2016/images</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2016/images/"><![CDATA[<p>People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there and remain unknown, and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voices in the minds of people weave a devastating tale. Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition. It happens because, in our society, there are standards, hierarchies and a shallow structure of persona. There will always be people better than you – that is a cliche of nihilism. But taking yourself into irrelevance is not a profound critique of Being. It is a cheap trick of a rational mind. You have to understand that failure is the price we pay for those standards, and, because mediocrity has consequences both real and harsh, standards are necessary.</p> <p>What but wilful blindness could possibly shelter people from such withering criticism?</p> <p>A more dismal, wretched, pessimistic philosophy explains that things are so terrible at the bottom that only delusion can save you. It is for such a reason that a whole generation of social psychologists recommended ‘positive illusion’ as the only reliable route to mental health. Because Mental health is not a question that the answer is written. Mental health is you fighting against you with all of you. Mental health is understanding and believing in good things about you even it does not sound familiar. Mental health needs will-power to improve everything that bothers you, physically, physiologically and mentally.</p> <p>If your cards are always stacked against you, perhaps the game you are playing is somehow rigged. If the internal voice makes you doubt the value of your endeavour or your life. Perhaps you should stop listening. Maybe its comments are chatter, not wisdom. Everything you do in your life, every game you play does not end at success and failure. If there was not better or worse, nothing would be worth doing. Why make an effort if it does not improve anything. Mental health is not a game, is not a mathematics or a scientific question. It’s a state of being. Maybe the game you are playing does not fit you. There are games that match your talent, your unique mix of strengths, weakness, and situation, involve you productively with other people and sustain and even improve yourself across time. The world allows for many ways of being if you don’t succeed at one, you can try another. Furthermore, if changing games does not work, you can invent a new one.</p> <p>But why does it happen? When we are very young we are neither individual informed. We have not had the time nor gained the wisdom to develop our own standards. In consequence, we must compare ourselves to others, because the standards are necessary. Without them, there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. As we mature we become, by contrast, increasingly individual and unique. The conditions of our lives become more and more personal and less and less comparable with those of others. Be cautious when you are comparing yourself to others. You are a singular being, once you are an adult. You have your own particular, specific problems – financial, intimate, psychological, and otherwise. Those are embedded in the unique broader context of your existence. Your career or job works for you in a personal manner, or it does not, and it does so in a unique interplay with the other specifics of your life. You must decide how much of your time to spend on this, and how much on that. You must decide what to let go, and want to pursue. You have nature. You can play the tyrant to it, but you will certainly a rebel. How to keep the fight up until you win? Pay attention. Focus on your surroundings, physical and physiological. Notice something that bothers you, that concerns you, that will not let you be, which you could fix, that you would fix. There are problems at the bottom of your eyes. Maybe there is a stack of paper on your desk, and you have been avoiding it. There are terrible things lurking there: tax forms, bill and letters. Notice your fear and have some sympathy for it. Maybe there are snakes in that pile of papers. Maybe you’ll get bitten. How could you possibly cope with something like that? Ask yourself, is there anything at all that I might be willing to do about that pile of paper? Determine yourself. Dare yourself to look at it for few seconds only. You might soon find that the entire file shrinks insignificance, merely because you have looked at part of it and you will find that the whole thing is made of parts. That’s how you should look at your deeply rooted problems. Ask yourself for a voluntary contribution. If you ask nicely and listen carefully, and don’t try any treachery, you would always find a way-out. Now you will be asking yourself, habitually, what could I do that, I would do, to make life a little better. You are not dictating yourself what better must be. Set your sight on the betterment of being. Align yourself, in your soul, with truth and the highest good. There is a habitable order to establish and beauty to bring into existence. There is evil to overcome, suffering to ameliorate, and yourself to better. You have to articulate your own standards of value. Determine the nature of your moral obligation, to yourself. You are nested within a network of social obligations. But this does not mean you must take the rule of lap – dog, obedient and harmless. This’s how a dictator wants his slaves. Whenever you face your fear. Close your eyes and let it tell you what it wants. Don’t let fear stop you. You don’t have to act it out, just because you’re thinking it. If it wants you to drag like a rat. Face it. God only knows what battles must be fought, forthrightly, voluntarily, on the road to peace. If still, something stops you. Try this way. Ask, “Who are you?”. Before purchasing a new house as you hire an inspector to tell the good and bad about the house, similarly, there is an internal critique inside you. You must understand this critique. This will tell you about your hidden flaws and inadequacies. you must walk through your psychological house with it and listen judiciously to what it says. Because you need to know. Because you can’t fix something if you don’t know it is broken and you are broken. Once you have found something then how can you start your renovations without being demoralized, even crossed, by your internal critiques lengthy and painful report your inadequacies? The internal critic will suggest something to set an order, which you could set in order, which you would set in order – voluntarily, without resentment, even with pleasure. Ask yourself: is there one thing that exists in disarray in your life or your situation that you could, and would, set straight? What but of chaos might I eradicate at home, on my desk, in my kitchen, tonight, so the stage could set for a better play? Aim small. You don’t want to shoulder too much, to begin with, given your talents, tendency to deceive, but enough resentment, and the ability to shrink responsibility. Do. What could I do, that I would do, that would accomplish that, and what small thing would I like as a reward. Decide to do even if badly. reward yourself. Do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that is magic. That’s compound interest. Do that for three years, Now you are wishing on a star. Now the beam is disappearing from your eye, and you are learning to see. And what you aim at determines what you see. That is worth repeating what you aim at determines what you see. Dare, instead, to be dangerous. Dear to be truthful. Dare to articulate yourself and express what would really justify your life. If you allowed your dark and unspoken desires to your partner, for example, to manifest themselves if you are even willing to consider them – you might discover that they were not so dark, given the light of day. You might discover, state that you are just afraid and, so, pretending to be a model. You might find that getting what you actually desire should I stop you from being tempted and strain. Are you so true that your partner would be unhappy if more of you rose to the surface? Consult your resentment. It is a revelatory emotion, for all its pathology. It is part of an evil triad: arrogance, deceit, and resentment. Nothing causes more harm than this underworld Trinity.</p> <p>When you have something to say silence is a lie – and tyranny feeds on lies. When you start nursing secret fantasies of revenge; when your life is being poisoned and your imagination fills with the wish to devour and destroy. It’s time to push back against oppression, despite the danger. You may not feel the change. Because you are blind. Because Vision is expensive- psychophysiologically expensive; neurologically expensive. Very little of your retina is the high-resolution fovea. We point to high-resolution capacities at the few specific things we are aiming at. And we let everything else-which is almost everything-fade, unnoticed, into the background. There is much more of the world that there is for you. Seeing is very difficult, so you must choose what to see, and let the rest go. The future is like the past. But there is a crucial difference. The past is fixed, but the future – it could be better. It could be better, some precise amount – the amount that can be achieved, perhaps in a day, with some minimal engagements. The present is an eternal flood. But where you start might not be important as the direction you are heading.</p> <blockquote> <p><em>Perhaps happiness is always to be found in the journey to uphill, not in the fleeting sense of satisfaction awaiting at the next peak. We must become conscious of our desires, and articulate them, and prioritize them, and arrange them into hierarchies.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The realisation is dawning. To journey happily may well be better than arrive successfully. Ask, and you shall receive. Knock, open. If you ask, as if you want, and knock as if you want to enter, you may be offered the chance to improve your life, a little: a lot, completely – and with that improvement, some progress will be made in being itself.</p> <p><strong>Compare yourself to who you are yesterday, not to who someone else’s today.</strong></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People are unhappy at the bottom. They get sick there and remain unknown, and unloved. They waste their lives there. They die there. In consequence, the self-denigrating voices in the minds of people weave a devastating tale. Life is a zero-sum game. Worthlessness is the default condition. It happens because, in our society, there are standards, hierarchies and a shallow structure of persona. There will always be people better than you – that is a cliche of nihilism. But taking yourself into irrelevance is not a profound critique of Being. It is a cheap trick of a rational mind. You have to understand that failure is the price we pay for those standards, and, because mediocrity has consequences both real and harsh, standards are necessary.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A stage of internal war and peace</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2015/formatting-and-links/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A stage of internal war and peace"/><published>2015-06-11T05:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-06-11T05:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2015/formatting-and-links</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2015/formatting-and-links/"><![CDATA[<p>This is an old piece 16 years-old-me wrote while interning at IIT Mandi.</p> <p>It was 2:34 AM, I sat cross-legged near the window gazing into the distance, this time it was the electricity that was long gone, darkness encapsulated an overly large room of this hostel I was trapped in and mind on loud like a wave hitting shores every second,</p> <p>It was dark as far as I could see outside, moon and mountains but clouded and covered,</p> <p>Sudden I heard the pitter-patter sound from the roof, I guessed it was raining.</p> <p>I placed my face over the net of the window, it was cold, a delicate gush of wind touched my skin,</p> <p>I could feel the rain gently caressing my face slowly and slowly, although it was pushing my hairs away.</p> <p>An ‘inexplicable’ scent of drenched earth made me smile and sway,</p> <p>This smell, air, darkness, sound, rain, it was home to a hoard of the memories black and white and I reminisced the old-time,</p> <p>How I used to go against mum’s order and rush into the rain to get out drenched and soak every falling drop right into my skin,</p> <p>falling asleep in mum’s lap while listening to fairytales, lullabies;</p> <p>God! How amazingly beautiful this was.</p> <p>This time again, I wanted to go out wet in rain, I wanted to recall everything little damn things that could put a smile on my face but I was afraid if I get cold or sick, nobody would be here to advise me to take a short nap. It’s again long gone with the electricity.</p> <p>Isn’t it a bit sad that as you grow older you have to let go of a few things you ever had gripped tight just to end up crashing into the bottom low, perhaps it is this cycle of keep going and going and going for the greater good? honestly? don’t know. But it feels good and natural to go with the flow and not being stagnant.</p> <p>Now when it rains I remember home with a sigh. I pick guitar or violin and bruise my finger against the string to fill love in the air, muffling the dissonance outside and chaos within, I play with the strings to bring all those long-gone things possibly back to life, I make a home in music and it never felt so alone.</p> <p>It is 4:53 AM. All of sudden, the electricity brightens up my room and a phone call from home. :)</p> <blockquote> <p>We do not grow absolutely, chronologically.
