## Zero-dimensional quantum systems

Imagine a quantum system with a finite number of states $N$. The Hamiltonian of such a system is represented by a matrix $H$ of dimension $N\times N$.
This matrix is Hermitian, $H=H^\dagger$. Its real eigenvalues $E_n$ correspond to the allowed energies of the system,

$$
H\,\left|n\right\rangle = E_n\,\left|n\right\rangle\,,
$$

with $\left|n\right\rangle$ the corresponding eigenstate. Let's say that $H$ describes a small quantum dot with a few levels. We can imagine that the quantum dot is in weak contact with a metallic lead, as in the following sketch:

+++

![](figures/dot.svg)

+++

The presence of a metallic lead allows us to measure all the energies $E_n$ of the electronic states in the dot with respect to the Fermi level $E_F$ of the electrons in the metallic lead. In the following we will set $E_F=0$. Hence, all negative energies $E_n&lt;0$ correspond to filled states in the dot, and all positive energies $E_n&gt;0$ to empty states. In the sketch, the lead and the dot are separated by a potential barrier, such that they are only coupled very weakly. Thus, we can still consider the dot as an isolated system, to a good approximation.

+++

We are now ready to start on the main theme of this course, topology.

### Topology and gapped quantum systems

Topology studies whether objects can be transformed continuously into each other. In condensed matter physics we can ask whether the Hamiltonians of two quantum systems can be continuously transformed into each other. If that is the case, then we can say that two systems are 'topologically equivalent'.

If we considered all Hamiltonians without any constraint, every Hamiltonian could be continuously deformed into every other Hamiltonian, and all quantum systems would be topologically equivalent. This changes drastically if we restrict ourselves to systems with an energy gap. This means that there is a finite energy cost to excite the system above its ground state.
If an energy gap is present, then the Hamiltonian of the system has no eigenvalues in a finite interval around zero energy.

We can now use the following criterion: we say that two gapped quantum systems are topologically equivalent if their Hamiltonians can be continuously deformed into each other *without ever closing the energy gap*.

In the following, we will see that often one is interested in some more specific criterion: for instance, that some symmetry may be preserved throughout the continuous path which connects two Hamiltonians.

However, for the moment let's just see these ideas at play using our quantum dot as a simple test case. Imagine our dot is initially described by a random $H$, such as:

```{code-cell} ipython3

np.random.seed(30)
H0 = make_random_real_ham(N=4)
pprint_matrix(H0)
</code></pre></div></div> <p>For simplicity, we have taken $H$ to be real. Let’s now deform this Hamiltonian into another Hamiltonian $H’$, also real. We can imagine that this deformation describes the changes that occur to the dot as an external parameter, such as a gate voltage, is varied. We can parameterize the deformation by</p> \[H(\alpha) = \alpha H' + (1-\alpha) H,\] <p>so that at $\alpha=0$ we are at the initial Hamiltonian and at $\alpha=1$ we are at the final Hamiltonian. Let’s see what the energy levels do as a function of $\alpha$ (we use more levels here than in the matrix above so that the spectrum looks more interesting).</p> <p>```{code-cell} ipython3</p> <p>np.random.seed(69) H0 = make_random_real_ham(N=10) H1 = make_random_real_ham(N=10) spectrum = find_spectrum(alphas, H0, H1) plot_hamiltonian_spectrum(alphas, spectrum)</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
You may notice from the plot that as $\alpha$ varies, it can happen that an energy level crosses zero energy. When this happens, we break the condition that there should be an energy gap in the system. Notice, however, that this does not necessarily mean that there is no continuous transformation between $H$ and $H'$ such that the gap does not close. It simply means that this particular path has gap closings. Perhaps it is possible to find another path which does not.

So are $H$ and $H'$ topologically equivalent or not? Let's look at this situation:

```{code-cell} ipython3

np.random.seed(6)
H0 = make_random_real_ham(N=10)
H1 = make_random_real_ham(N=10)
spectrum = find_spectrum(alphas, H0, H1)
plot_hamiltonian_spectrum(alphas, spectrum)
</code></pre></div></div> <p>We see that one level does cross zero (even twice), but it seems obvious that we can just push it down a little bit and we find a continuous path between two Hamiltonians. So we need to come up with an easier way to figure out if Hamiltonians can be transformed into each other or not.</p> <h2 id="the-concept-of-a-topological-invariant">The concept of a topological invariant</h2> <p>In order to know whether there is any path which connects $H$ and $H’$ without closing the gap, we can count the number of levels below zero energy, i.e. the number of filled energy levels. This is possible because the eigenvalues of gapped Hamiltonians can move freely as long as they don’t cross zero energy. Therefore continuous transformations exist exactly between Hamiltonians with the same number of energy levels below zero.</p> <p>Since this number can not change under continuous transformations inside the set of gapped Hamiltonians, we call it a <em>topological invariant</em> $Q$.</p> <p>Below, we plot the energy levels along our path from $H$ to $H’$ again, together with our topological invariant, the number of filled energy levels. You can see that this number changes between 3, 4 and 5. Hence we can say that $H$ and $H’$ are not topologically equivalent.</p> <p>```{code-cell} ipython3</p> <p>np.random.seed(69) H0 = make_random_real_ham(N=10) H1 = make_random_real_ham(N=10) spectrum = find_spectrum(alphas, H0, H1) Q = find_Q(spectrum) ( plot_hamiltonian_spectrum(alphas, spectrum) + plot_Q(alphas, Q, [2, 6]) ).cols(1) ```</p> <p>The plot makes it clear that we do not actually have to count the number of filled energy levels for both $H$ and $H’$, so it is enough to keep track of <em>zero energy crossings</em>. Whenever an energy level crosses zero energy, the number of levels below zero energy changes. Such a crossing therefore changes the topological invariant. We call that a <em>topological phase transition</em>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="education"/><category term="physics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An introductory look at the core principles of quantum mechanics.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quantum Mechanics 101: Demystifying Its Postulates</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/QuantumMech/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quantum Mechanics 101: Demystifying Its Postulates"/><published>2025-02-17T05:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-02-17T05:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/QuantumMech</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/QuantumMech/"><![CDATA[<blockquote> <p><em>“If quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet.”</em><br/> – Niels Bohr</p> </blockquote> <p>Quantum mechanics is often described as one of the most mind-bending fields of physics, not just because of its abstract nature but because of the very real, fundamental concepts it reveals about our universe. As someone who first encountered quantum mechanics in my sophomore physics course, I can attest to the confusion and awe that come with it. From the strange notion of particles existing as a probability until observed, to the idea of wavefunctions that govern everything, the journey through quantum mechanics is both intellectually thrilling and deeply perplexing.</p> <p>Over the years, whether through my undergraduate or master’s courses, I repeatedly encountered concepts that initially seemed bizarre and not very application-oriented. Among these were ideas such as the unitarity of operators, time evolution, time-dependent versus time-independent states, and the Hermiticity of operators. At first, these principles felt abstract and difficult to apply outside the classroom. However, as I progressed into more advanced courses like Quantum Field Theory, these concepts became essential to understanding the subject. Often, it takes multiple reviews, months of rethinking, and even fresh perspectives to truly make the connections.</p> <p>While quantum mechanics is an immensely powerful framework for understanding the microscopic world, it can be frustratingly abstract, requiring a solid understanding of both its mathematical structure and the physical intuition behind it. In this article, I aim to offer an accessible explanation of these foundational ideas for undergraduates or graduate students, with a focus on understanding quantum mechanics from a more tangible, relatable viewpoint.</p> <h2 id="classical-vs-quantum-the-idea-of-the-qubit">Classical vs Quantum: The Idea of the Qubit</h2> <p>In classical mechanics, the most basic unit of information is the <strong>bit</strong>, which represents a binary value—either 0 or 1. Imagine these bits as simple “on” or “off” states, much like flipping a light switch.</p> <p>Quantum mechanics, however, introduces a new and strange concept: the <strong>quantum bit</strong> or <strong>qubit</strong>. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a state that is both 0 and 1 simultaneously, a phenomenon known as <strong>superposition</strong>.</p> <p>A qubit is described mathematically as:</p> \[|\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle\] <p>where $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are complex numbers that satisfy the normalization condition:</p> \[|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1\] <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Here, $</td> <td>0\rangle $ and $</td> <td>1\rangle $ represent the classical bit states, but now, the qubit can exist in a linear combination of these states.

To dive deeper into this, we turn to the <strong>postulates of quantum mechanics</strong>, which govern the behavior of quantum systems.</p> <h2 id="postulates-of-quantum-mechanics">Postulates of Quantum Mechanics</h2> <p>The postulates of quantum mechanics provide the foundational principles that govern the behavior of quantum systems. These postulates are the rules that form the structure of quantum mechanics, and they help explain phenomena such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement. Here is a summary of the key postulates:</p> <h3 id="postulate-1-state-representation-and-quantum-space">Postulate 1: State Representation and Quantum Space</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>In quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum system is represented by a <strong>vector</strong> in a <strong>complex vector space</strong> (specifically, a <strong>Hilbert space</strong>).

Dirac, the corresponding <strong>bra</strong> $ \langle \psi</td> <td>$ is the <em>dual</em> of the ket.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>In a more familiar notion that’s in matrix form, the state $</td> <td>\psi\rangle $ is represented as a <em>column vector</em>, while the corresponding dual $ \langle \psi</td> <td>$ is the complex conjugate transpose (<em>row vector</em>) of that vector.

This normalization condition is written as:</p> \[\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1\] <p>This condition is referred to as the <strong>normalization condition</strong>. It is not a purely mathematical constraint, but rather arises from a physical consideration, namely, the <strong>conservation of probabilities</strong>.

In classical mechanics, measurements can give us a definite value, but quantum mechanics introduces an element of uncertainty. When measuring physical quantities, the set of eigenvalues of the corresponding Hermitian operator gives the possible values that can be obtained from the measurement.

src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*odFY9m9MBawrlUePhayATg.png" alt=""/></p> <p>(In Fig: Male Grandalas are blue and Females are the brown or grey ones.)</p> <p>Darwin, in a letter, wrote to Asa Gray, “The sight of a feather in a peacock’s tail, whenever I gaze on it, makes me sick!” The seeming impossibility of explaining the gorgeous but impractical long tail of peacock had been bothering him for some time. He was so curious to know what causes the sexual differences which require some degree of self-consciousness in the males, as weapons by which they fight for the female, or ornaments that attract the opposite sex.</p> <p>His previous theory of ‘Natural Selection’ could only operate to spread a particular feature through a population, no matter how advantageous it might be if the individuals who possessed it, managed to breed and pass it on. Sexual differences between male and female of the same species had bothered him for a long time.</p> <p>But what are the apparent differences between the sexes? As it’s been observed, exotic colour in insects and birds, ornaments like ruffs and crests, the longer manes in male humans, Antlers or horns being so much smaller, or completely absent in some female deer or cattle, the contrasting bright and drab plumage of so many male and female birds and butterflies.</p> <p>After a long period of observation, he came with the idea of Sexual Selection. It’s a mechanism operating alongside natural selection which determines the sexual difference between male and female of the same species. It is a mechanism of two parts — involving physical adaptation in males, but also the aesthetic sense in females, which in many cases played a crucial role in selecting males.</p> <p>“The essence of Darwin’s disruptive genius was his ability to think about nature not as facts— but as a process, as progression, as history,” Mukherjee writes. Darwin’s genius was the awe-inspiring idea of Natural Selection. On December 27, 1831, he circumnavigated from Plymouth, England on HMS Beagle and headed towards Cape Verde to reach the shore of his intimate inquisitiveness surveying expedition of the southern Atlantic and Pacific oceans. As a scientist-in-training his never-ending thoughts of collecting, observing and noticing anything worthy to be noted made him sail the boat for five long years across many islands. During his journey as he writes in his book The Origin of Species, that he strongly felt lonely, nauseated, and dehydrated at times while surviving on a diet of dry raisins and bread. He kept believing in and reminding himself to stay calm and mentally healthy to avoid any propensity for impatience, inaccuracy and misery. As the journey went on, the expected evolutionary biological traits perplexed and thrilled him with joy and confidence, that he began writing and scribbling in his notes and journals. He observed and drew finches, penguins, birds, animals encountered throughout his journey. After five years when he returned to England, his drawings were the evidence of his proposed groundbreaking scientific work and the profound idea of natural selection that he almost had formulated and thoerised. But he was wary to reveal his collection and theories as they were completely contradicting the existed biblical narratives on the origin of species. He writes, “In natural selection, organisms with genetic variations that suit their environment tend to propagate more descendants than organisms of the same species that lack the variation, thus influencing the overall genetic makeup of the species”. Later on, this idea solved many underlying and lurking religious orthodox, biblical stories, biological mysteries and puzzles.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*rtIJQkPfa1neEWflYvD2tw.jpeg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>The gene — An intimate History’ by Siddharth Mukherjee</em> In his drawing, there was no centre (as in Christianity, God firmly is placed at epicentre: all animals, created by him sprayed outward from the moment of creation). The thirteen types of finches he drew were not created by some divine whim, but by “natural descent” — cascading downward and upward from an original ancestral finch, he asserted.</p> </blockquote> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/0*PjEmLTdraH14lLT5.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>A portrait of Charles Darwin and Title Page of ‘The Origin Of Species</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Later, on November 24, 1859, his first book “The Origin of Species” endorsing the theory of Natural Selection and the fundamentals of biological evolution was published. His theory that time was not formally accepted as it was very challenging to the previously acquired wisdom of humankind. It took a while for our society to accept the scientific challenges Darwin made based on the shreds of evidence he collected, a life span he spent and devoted to observations, understandings and pursuit of science. His theory received a general acceptance around 1882, after 52 years of social struggle, almost when Darwin had the last moments of his gratifying endeavour and the invaluable contribution he made to the scientific societies.</p> <p>After he received a good amount of acceptance (validation) to his theory, postcolonial societies led by industrial revolutions extracted a set of ideologies as ‘Social Darwinism’ to define social, political and economic views when imperialism, racism and inequalities were breeding at an immense rate in the society. Darwins’ theory of evolution and Social Darwinism are two different theories where the former is a biological evolution that progresses by sharing biological traits genetically and the later is a societal change that shares morality, intelligence, strength, frugality and many more. Darwin completely despised the transferring-evolution of social values developed by humankind through generations.</p> <p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/0*JcuJI7j-Ob8skckf.jpg" alt=""/></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Photo: Westminster Abbey Library</em> As an afterthought, he added “I think” above the page, as if to signal is the last point of departure from the mainland of biological and theological thoughts. His proposition “I think” above societal incongruity that all species have descended from a common ancestor is now a fundamental concept in science and the idea of survival “Natural Selection: endless forms and most beautiful and most wonderful have been, are being, evolved” is the grassroots of evolutionary biology.</p> </blockquote> <p>==Sometimes we need to really challenge our collective accepted wisdom in order to move forward. Because as long and as much time any theory or wisdom takes to transcend the physical time and persists in society, it gets harder and harder to challenge them and invalidate its gravity.==</p> <p><strong>Science and Technology continuously have been advancing with the progressiveness of society and research but in molecular and evolutionary biology Darwin’s genius and ideas have always remained central to the field.</strong></p> <p>Note: The following (<em>“A beautiful flock of grandalas!”</em>) contrasting colours and subtle differences were also studied by the Handicap Principle supported by many Evolutionary biologists, and is why peacocks have such long tails, even though they are a burden for flight and evading predators.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="darwin"/><category term="sexualselection"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sexual Selection]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Still Vulnerable at 25</title><link href="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Still Vulnerable at 25"/><published>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-10T02:29:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mishrakishan.github.io/blog/2025/twitter/"><![CDATA[<p>The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another. And realisation hits hard, and you fall down into an inward spiral in the depths of nowhere.</p> <p>The hot coffee would steam on a bright sunny day as you sit bored on your couch. Unwilling to move muscles, you would remain there, staring into the void while your brain would start to do “the talking”. The talks, most of, if not all the time, would be dark. Scared, you start craving activity. Yet, you wouldn’t want to cut ties with lethargy without a proper closure. So, you would start with a gentle peek out of the window. Muscle movement achieved! Like a yorker right into the black hole, the sun would slap your face tight. “The window was there for a reason!”, your brain wouldn’t seem to give up. You would stare at the world outside. You would wonder at a white feather being kissed by the winds, shining as its manoeuver past you! You would start falling in love with almost everything that you see through the window. “I see. Now what about this?”, our brain cuts in. Then, you would table-fan your head slightly to the sides to find gigantic wings on either side of your shoulders. “Hehe!”, the asshole of a brain would give you a manipulative laugh. It would make you want to use the wings because flying high would give you a different form of high. Adding fuel to the fire, the typical midsummer breeze outside the window would stage a ballet in your face. ” This gets interesting”, your brain grabs a popcorn while you stay there like a total jackass gridlocked by the two differently haunting weapons of choice. The window would almost slap harder as the breeze starts gusting, if not for the latch. It doesn’t stop there. The rooftop that’d been watching everything just above you blows out open and you see light entering and skies smiling at you.</p> <p>One of the quotes by Camus hits right in my face of vulnerability every time I get stuck in a situation like this,</p> <p><em>Sad to still feel so vulnerable. In 25 years I’ll be 57. 25 years then to create a body of work and to find what I’m looking for. After that, old age and death. I know what is most important for me. And I still find a way to give in to little temptations, wasting time of frivolous conversations or fruitless idling about. I’ve mastered two or three things in myself. But how far I am from the kind of superiority that I so badly need.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="solitude"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The chair of solitude is so comforting until it’s an unexplainable, suffocating silence that rebels against the pursuit of “living a life in love’, recognition, pity, validation or attention other than any honest attempt to communicate an understanding.” If building castles in the air would be one thing, building haunted devil mansions would be another.

You expect it to be easy. You expect it to be a world of roses and laughs and perfect moments that you find only in movies. You expect your partner to always say the right thing and always know exactly how you feel, or exactly how to react to it. You expect them to calm you down when you’re yelling or to chase you when you run away. You expect so much that you feel entirely, and utterly defeated when something doesn’t exactly match up with all your plans. But that’s the thing, love isn’t a plan. Love is a feeling. It’s that feeling you get when you know you are going to see that person. You are always counting down the minutes, the hours, the days or even months until you will see them again because you love that feeling you have when you are with them.</p> <p>Love is a feeling of perfect happiness. Being in their arms means that everything will be okay and even if it’s really not going to be, you’ll get a feeling that they’ll do whatever they can to make it be, or just to try to make you feel better. It’s that feeling that you are loved for who you are and you love them for who they are. It’s about how they are the first ones you want to talk to when anything is good or bad and how you are always learning something new no matter how long you’ve been together. It’s about changing and being a new person, not necessarily changing your ways or who you are, but wanting to be different and a better person simply cause that person is in your life and you want to be everything to them.</p> <p>Love doesn’t have a certain beginning and it certainly has no end or visible finish line to those deeply in it. Love happens, and it is so incredibly messy. You don’t just automatically love someone. you have to slowly learn to trust; Trust that they don’t cheat on you, trust that they don’t lie to you, trust that they truly admire you, trust that they will always be there for you, trust that they can go to a party and not get high or drunk, trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you trust that you don’t have to worry about them breaking up with you the second you wake up, trust that they will stick up for you, trust that they will never fall in love with another, trust that they won’t just get sick of you, and trust that they want you, like you want them. You want to be with them more to the point where you’re jealous of anyone who tries to be with that person. Then it gets you mad but you get past it, you can’t be jealous anymore. You can’t because you have this undying confidence that this person will never leave you, they will never betray you, and that they would never pick someone else over you, that you’re irreplaceable. That’s when the confidence hits you, that you really do love each other and it’s unbreakable.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing"/><category term="love"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Love is a funny thing.
